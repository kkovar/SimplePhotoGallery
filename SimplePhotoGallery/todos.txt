I can upload to a gallery directory with the desired resized images.
1. Display all of the images not in a gallery on a page with a dropdown next to each image that specifies what g
gallery the image should go into. If the user picks a gallery that does not exist, create the gallery and add it 
to the other dropdowns. There will be a master dropdown that will allow all unassigned pictures to be put into a 
gallery, and an ok button to confirm the user's choice. This view will be called GalleryAssignment. The new
gallery will appear on the GalleryDirectory page, which will be shown after the user confirms that they are
done with assigning the pictures. So the controller will have the following:
Initialize - get all unassigned images and tell the view to display them.
AddImageToGallery - image will be associated with a gallery


View will have the following: AddImage, SetGalleryLists (will populate all the dropdowns)
SetMasterGallery (will change all dropdowns that have not been preset)

Nice to have: more than one gallery per image. ui indication that an image has been assigned to a gallery.
Simplest would be that the dropdown is populated

2. The gallery will have around 10-30 images in one or more rows of thumbs and a large image for
the currently selected image in the thumbs.

Moving to siemens laptop: 
Restored database to sql2014 server. Fixed connection string in project, so i could browse the tables in server explorer.


Change:
 <connectionStrings>
    <add name="GalleryContext" connectionString="Data Source=localhost\DEVELOPMENT;Initial Catalog=SimplePhotoGallery.Models.GalleryContext;Integrated Security=True" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
  </connectionStrings>
 
 Now my images are missing and importing new ones will not have the same name. all I have is the uploader to repopulate
 the gallery.

spg: develop gallery admin page where a user can map directories to galleries and pick the images that will go into a gallery.

user will have a page that shows the local directories. browse for a directory and the server will map the directory 
to a route that reflects the users description
so we will have D:\Users\z003czax\My Pictures\fromAlcatel mapped to something like localhost/galleries/alcatel


work on orchard
do gallery with strips of images
have a controller that runs a search for images (jpeg's, but user can select extension') and puts the iist into a nice form

I can upload to a gallery directory with the desired resized images.
1. Display all of the images not in a gallery on a page with a dropdown next to each image that specifies what g
gallery the image should go into. If the user picks a gallery that does not exist, create the gallery and add it 
to the other dropdowns. There will be a master dropdown that will allow all unassigned pictures to be put into a 
gallery, and an ok button to confirm the user's choice. This view will be called GalleryAssignment. The new
gallery will appear on the GalleryDirectory page, which will be shown after the user confirms that they are
done with assigning the pictures. So the controller will have the following:
Initialize - get all unassigned images and tell the view to display them.
AddImageToGallery - image will be associated with a gallery


View will have the following: AddImage, SetGalleryLists (will populate all the dropdowns)
SetMasterGallery (will change all dropdowns that have not been preset)

Nice to have: more than one gallery per image. ui indication that an image has been assigned to a gallery.
Simplest would be that the dropdown is populated

2. The gallery will have around 10-30 images in one or more rows of thumbs and a large image for
the currently selected image in the thumbs.
